Healthy

People of this subtype are more outgoing: they seek love through the creation of personal connection and making others feel good. The self-esteem of a Two with a Three-wing is tied to personal qualities rather than the quality of service to others. They are sociable and talkative, charming and adaptable, with much “personality” in evidence. They enjoy bestowing whatever talents and resources they possess on friends and family—cooking, entertaining, singing, and listening—all as ways of sharing their inner bounty.

Average

People of this subtype are friendly and good-humored, although focused and ambitious. They are not typically into overt caretaking; more often they consider their friendship and the quality of their attention to be a sufficient gift to others. There can be a seductive aspect to people of this subtype, as well as more of a focus on relationships, excessive friendliness, exaggerated sentimentality, and histrionic displays, the result of the Threes desire for acceptance blending with the Twos drive for intimacy. Less serious and more task-driven than Twos with a One-wing, they are also less likely to engage in self-questioning and self-criticism. People of this subtype are direct about what they want, drawing attention to the services they provide. They can be self-important, high-handed, and sometimes arrogant.
