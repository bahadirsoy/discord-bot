Focus of Attention: Threes focus attention on tasks and goals to create an image of
success in the eyes of others. Threes identify with their work, believing they
are what they do, and lose touch with who they really are.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: For a Three, thinking centers on “doing”—on
accomplishing tasks and goals. Though a heart type, Threes (unconsciously)
avoid their feelings because getting caught up in emotion prevents them from
getting things done. When they slow down enough for emotions to surface,
they may feel a sense of sadness or anxiety related to being recognized for
what they do and not for who they are. Threes tend to express impatient anger
if someone or something gets between them and their goal.


Behavior Patterns: Threes tend to be fast-paced workaholics. They find it very
difficult to slow down and just “be.” They can be extremely productive and
effective because of their laser-like focus on getting things done and reaching
their goals.


Passion—Vanity: Vanity is a passionate concern for one’s image or for “living for
the eyes of others.” Vanity motivates Threes to present a false image to
others—to shape-shift into whatever image is the right or most successful
image for the context.
