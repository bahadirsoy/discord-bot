Focus of Attention: Sevens avoid unpleasant feelings by focusing on what feels
pleasant and by keeping the mood upbeat to the point of reframing negatives
into positives. A fear of being trapped in discomfort fuels quick thinking,
creative problem-solving, and a focus on positive future possibilities.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Sevens have quick, synthesizing minds, with which
they find links between the commonalities in different subjects, making rapid
mental associations. Emotionally, Sevens like feeling happy or joyful
emotions and dislike feeling fear, anxiety, sadness, boredom, pain, or
discomfort. Their attitude is, “Why feel pain if you can feel happy instead?”


Behavior Patterns: Sevens are energetic, fast-paced, innovative, and active. They
usually have many interests and activities, which they pursue with
enthusiasm. Sevens like planning for fun and maintaining many options, so
they can keep their mood up and shift to the most pleasant option if one plan
becomes undesirable or untenable.


Passion—Gluttony: While we commonly think of gluttony in connection with food
and eating too much, in the language of the Enneagram, gluttony is a passion
for pleasure and a desire for more—an excessive indulgence in consuming
whatever brings pleasure.
