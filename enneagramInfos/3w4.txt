Healthy

People of this subtype feel that self-esteem comes from their work and career success more than from personal qualities. They want their work to be outstanding and well regarded, often putting great energy into their careers. They take pleasure in whatever profession or “craft” they have chosen and are willing to make great personal sacrifices to maintain their professional integrity. While diplomatic and charming, they are more generally serious and task-oriented and can therefore resemble Ones.

Average

Powerful ambition and self-doubt mix in people of this subtype, inevitably creating tremendous pressures. Their drive for perfection is similar to that of Ones; however, they aspire to embody perfection in some way to avoid being rejected or shamed as inferior. People of this subtype feel they are putting their entire self-worth on the line with every project. They often project competence and poise but can be rather private socially (in contrast to the more outgoing and affable expressions of the other subtype). They may also display pretentiousness and arrogance, mixed with self-consciousness and self-contempt, making this subtype perplexing and sometimes at odds with itself.
