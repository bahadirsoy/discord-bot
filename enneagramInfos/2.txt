Focus of Attention: Twos focus on relationships, gaining approval, and seducing
others through helpfulness as a strategic way to get their disowned needs met.
Twos actively “read” the people around them and align with (what they
perceive to be) their moods and preferences in order to maximize the potential
for positive connection.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Emotionally, Twos fear rejection and so they
frequently repress their feelings in an effort to please others. When their
emotions can no longer be repressed, they may display anger, sadness,
anxiety, or hurt. Because of these contradictory impulses, Twos may feel
emotionally conflicted. Twos also express happy feelings as a way of
appearing likable to others.


Behavior Patterns: Twos tend to be upbeat, energetic, and friendly, though
sometimes this can mask (and be an overcompensation for) repressed needs
and a tendency toward depression. They are driven and hardworking,
especially in the service of others or a project they feel passionately about, but
they can also be hedonistic and self-indulgent. Twos may also play the role of
martyr, sacrificing their own needs and desires to win over others, but then
suffering for it.


Passion—Pride: In the language of the Enneagram, pride functions as a need for
self-inflation and gets expressed as a false generosity in the service of
seduction and self-elevation. Pride also fuels a pattern of self-idealization and
grandiosity, followed by a reactive devaluation and self-criticism.
