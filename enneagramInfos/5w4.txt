Healthy

Curiosity and perceptiveness combine in this subtype with the desire to express a unique, personal vision. These people are more emotional, introspective, and creative than Fives with a Six-wing. They seek a niche that has not been explored by othersâ€”something that can truly be their own. Not scientifically oriented, they are often creative loners, mixing passion and detachment. They are whimsical and inventive: their tinkering with familiar forms can lead to startling innovations. Often drawn to the arts, they use the imagination more than the analytic, systematic parts of their minds.

Average

Although primarily identified with their minds, people of this subtype struggle with intense feelings that can create difficulties in sustaining efforts and in working with others. They are more independent than the other subtype and resist having structures imposed on them. Their interests tend toward the surreal and fantastic rather than the rational or the romantic: they can easily get lost in their own cerebral landscapes. They often have difficulty staying grounded and can become impractical in the pursuit of their interests. They can be attracted to dark, forbidden subject matter or to the disturbing or grotesque.
