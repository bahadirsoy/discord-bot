Focus of Attention: Like the “superego” function of Freud’s model, Ones focus on
noticing error (in the form of deviations from an internally generated ideal),
discerning right and wrong, and displaying a reliance on rules and structure.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Emotionally, Ones often feel resentment and
irritation or anger that is restrained. The communication of aggression is in
conflict with their belief that expressing anger is bad, so anger and other
instinctual impulses are typically held back and then leak out as resentment,
annoyance, criticism, and self-righteousness. Ones believe that there is a
“right way” to do things and that we should all try to be more perfect.


Behavior Patterns: Ones can be perceived as being rigid and highly structured in
their behavior, relying on ritual and repetitive forms of doing. Typically, they
follow the rules and are reliable, ethical, and hardworking.


Passion—Anger: As an emotional passion, anger appears in its repressed form for
Ones as resentment that seeks resolution in pursuing perfection and virtue.
Ones display hostility toward the imperfect way things are and try to force
things to conform to their ideal of how things should be.
