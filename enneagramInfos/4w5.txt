For better or worse, they are usually defiant of convention and authority, breaking the rules whenever self-expression is an issue.

People of this subtype prefer downbeat scenes, choosing a minimalistic lifestyle. They can be intensely private, often seeing themselves as rebellious outsiders. They may have brilliant flashes of insight, but they have trouble sustaining practical efforts in the real world.
