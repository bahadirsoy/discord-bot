Healthy

People of this subtype combine strength, self-confidence, and determination with quiet groundedness and a certain laid-back quality. They are noticeably steadier in the pursuit of their aims and are not as openly aggressive or as easily perturbed as other Eights. They are also warmer and more family-oriented, asserting power and leadership through protectiveness. There is less of a “wheeler-dealer” quality in their makeup: while they also want to be independent, they want to do so at their own pace. The ability to reassure and calm others enhances their capacity for leadership.

Average

These people seem to have a dual nature, manifesting themselves differently in different areas of their lives. For instance, they can be warm and affectionate at home but highly determined and aggressive at work. People of this subtype generally like to live quietly and unobtrusively, preferring to control their affairs from behind the scenes. They also tend to speak slowly and to be highly attuned to the nonverbal cues and body language of others—friendly while secretly sizing people up. Strategic and watchful, they almost dare others to underestimate them. Eights of this subtype can be stubborn, impassive, and quietly menacing. When they lose their tempers, the explosion comes suddenly and violently, and then is gone.
