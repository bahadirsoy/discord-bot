Focus of Attention: Fours focus attention on their own feelings, the feelings of
others, and interpersonal connection and disconnection. They feel a sense of
deficiency about their own worth, so they seek idealized experiences of
qualities they perceive as outside themselves.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Fours value authentic expressions of a wide range
of emotion. Their thought patterns center on what is missing in a given
situation and on longing for whatever they perceive as ideal and somehow
unavailable. They appreciate meaningful interactions rooted in real feelings
and have a keen aesthetic sensibility based on the translation of emotional
experience into artistic expression, but they tend to overidentify with feelings
and dwell in melancholy (or anger).


Behavior Patterns: Fours can be reserved and withdrawn, or energetic and active,
or both. They are emotionally intuitive, empathic, and intense. While specific
behavior patterns vary according to subtype, Fours generally aren’t afraid of
conflict, will work tirelessly when they feel passionately connected to
something, and can see what’s missing and speak to it.


Passion—Envy: Envy manifests as a painful sense of lack and a craving toward
that which is felt lacking. For Fours, Envy grows out of an early sense of loss
that leads to a perception that something good is outside the Four’s
experience—and that this something is necessary but missing because of an
inner deficiency.
