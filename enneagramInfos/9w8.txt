Healthy

People of this subtype mix the ability to be agreeable and to comfort others with endurance and strength. They are both powerful and gentle, able to easily engage with people and with things in the world, mediating between people and lessening conflicts. They often seek new projects to have an occasional change of pace from their normal routines. They are also practical and are typically concerned with their immediate needs and physical and financial circumstances. More sociable than the other subtype, they generally prefer to work with other people. They excel in the helping professions and consulting and can be effective in business, especially in negotiations or in human resource capacities.

Average

These people enjoy socializing and good times and are more attracted to losing themselves in sensuality and comforting routines that interfere with their ability to stay focused on significant goals. They can be stubborn and defensive, tending to dig in their heels and refusing to listen to anyone. People of this subtype often have bad tempers, although it is difficult to predict what will set them offâ€”threats to their sense of personal well-being or to their family, job, or beliefs are typical. They can be blunt and explosive but suddenly return to a state of calm and placidity.
