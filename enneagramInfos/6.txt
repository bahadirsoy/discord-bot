Focus of Attention: Sixes focus on thinking about what might go wrong and
strategizing and preparing for it. A response to an early experience of danger,
Sixes have an adaptive strategy that centers on detecting threats and coping
with fear.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: It’s hard to talk about one kind of Six, because the
three Six subtypes are so distinct. This can be traced to the three commonly
understood ways of dealing with fear: fight, flight, or freeze. Analytical and
strategic in their thinking, Sixes think in terms of how to manage uncertainty
to feel safe. They think things through thoroughly, even to the point of getting
paralyzed by overanalysis. Aside from fear, they tend to have less access to
other feelings, though they can be the most feeling of the Head Types.


Behavior Patterns: Sixes are watchful and alert in different ways, and share a
common orientation to authority. They have a strong desire for a good
authority, but can be suspicious of and rebellious against real-life authorities.
Sixes are thoughtful and loyal to those whom they trust. They can be hard
workers, intent on control and achievement, or they can have a hard time
getting things done, getting caught up in procrastination, indecision, and fear
of success. Their constant awareness of what might go wrong makes them
excellent problem-solvers.


Passion—Fear: Fear is an unpleasant emotional and physiological response to
recognized sources of danger; it usually goes hand in hand with anxiety,
which can be more or less conscious, depending on the subtype. Anxiety
includes apprehension, tension, or uneasiness related to the anticipation of
danger, the source of which is unknown or unrecognized and may originate
inside one’s own mind.
