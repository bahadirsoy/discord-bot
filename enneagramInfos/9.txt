Focus of Attention: Nines focus attention on others, on what is going on in the
environment, and on avoiding conflict and achieving harmony. Nines
typically tune into what other people want, but do not have a clear sense of
their own agendas.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Nines focus on getting along with others without
“rocking the boat” and creating conflict. They’re emotionally steady and do
not feel many highs or lows. Though they are anger types, Nines usually don’t
feel their anger very often—they (unconsciously) dissociate from it as a way
to avoid conflict or separation from others—so it tends to leak out in
repressed forms, such as stubbornness or passive-aggressive behavior, or
escape in big bursts every once in a while.


Behavior Patterns: Nines like to “go with the flow,” and they automatically
accommodate the agendas of others as a way of unconsciously avoiding
expressing (or even registering) any preferences that could lead to conflict,
though they may passively resist later when hints of latent desires surface.
They dislike feeling controlled, but like structure and clear lines of authority.
They make good mediators because they have an easy ability to see all sides
of an issue and naturally find the common ground in conflicting points of
view.


Passion—Laziness: Laziness refers to an inaction of the psyche, a refusal to see, a
resistance to change, and an aversion to effort, especially with regard to being
aware of their own inner feelings, sensations, and desires. Rather than
reluctance to take action, this passion is more about inattention to self and
inertia of the will when it comes to tuning in to what is going on internally
