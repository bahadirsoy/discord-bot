Healthy

People of this subtype combine warmth with seriousness of purpose, as they strive after personal goodness and selfless service. The combination of the morality of the One and the empathy of the Two lead to a strong desire to relieve human suffering. These people are often Good Samaritans, willing to take on thankless and unglamorous tasks that others generally avoid. They are more serious-minded than the other subtype, more overt caretakers, often found in teaching, public service, healing professions, the ministry, and working with the disenfranchised or the physically or mentally challenged.

Average

People of this subtype feel obligated to struggle against their “selfish” attitudes and feelings: they feel responsible for others’ welfare and are typically dutiful, proper, and severe with themselves. They are emotional but tend to be strained in their emotional expressions because they feel awkward about drawing attention to themselves. They prefer working in the background, yet they want to feel significant in others’ lives. Twos with a One-wing feel conflicts between their emotional needs and their principles, often leading them to get involved in moral or religious teachings. They can become extremely self- critical and neglectful of their health, denying their personal needs and tending to play the martyr.
