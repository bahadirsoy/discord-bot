Focus of Attention: Eights naturally focus their attention on power and control—
who has it and who doesn’t, and how it’s wielded. They think in terms of the
big picture and (mostly) dislike dealing with details. They see the world as
being divided into “the strong” and “the weak,” and they identify with “the
strong” to avoid feeling weak.


Patterns of Thinking and Feeling: Emotionally, Eights usually have easy access to
anger and (unconsciously) avoid registering vulnerable feelings. They
typically appear fearless and can be intimidating to others, often without
meaning to be. They like to be in control, engage in black and white thinking,
think they know what’s best or true, and do not like to be told what to do.


Behavior Patterns: Eights have a lot of energy, can accomplish big things, can
confront others when necessary, and will protect people they care about. They
can be workaholics, taking on more and more without acknowledging their
physical limits, and refuse to experience vulnerable feelings that might slow
them down. They can sometimes overwork themselves, even to the point of
physical illness.

stimulation. It is a drive to fill up an inner emptiness through physical
