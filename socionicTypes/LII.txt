Obstinately tries to retain the system of relations to which he has become accustomed. Reserved about himself. Dislikes uninvited guests because he doesn’t know how to entertain and occupy them. Cautious in communication, often holds at a certain distance. The more he sympathizes with a person internally, the less outwardly demonstrative he is of his interest.

Frequently, he has one main interest within which he is constantly improving his knowledge and skill. Maintains a conversation only when it is on subjects that are of interest to him.

At home LII is modest, often satisfied by a minimum of conveniences. Daily chores have a suppressing and tiring effect on him.

In critical situations he may be somewhat indecisive. He can’t be forced to do anything by coercion.
