The ESE (ESFj) is emotional and communicative. Knows how to lift the mood, to cheer up other people. Enjoys talking about his contacts and acquaintances. His emotions change sharply: at times he is lighthearted and friendly, other times he is hot-tempered and angry. Pays attention to manners and correctness of behavior of people around him.

Caring and hospitable. Knows how to create comfort from what he has at hand. Watches for the well-being of his loved ones. Enjoys giving gifts and doing something pleasant for others. Excellent organizer of events, vacations and celebrations.

With difficulty contains his emotions. Nitpicks people whom he doesn’t like. Becomes very offended if his efforts are not appreciated. Quite fussy and scattered. Constantly overloaded with things to do, many of which can be foregone or postponed.

Poorly predicts major life upheavals and events. Expects only positive results and outcomes, thus is often subject to stress and disappointments from his unfulfilled hopes. Stable in his habits and methods of spending his free time. Over-estimates how much time he has left, and doesn’t finish everything that was planned. Often starts on important work in the last minute, which leads to unnecessary hurrying and agitation.
