The ILE (ENTp) is adept at seeing distant prospects. Inventive: always has numerous ideas and new projects. Indiscriminately interested in everything in hopes of finding something unique. Depreciates past achievements. Works on what is of interest to him, even if it doesnâ€™t guarantee any real returns.

ILE is rather scattered and inattentive - often loses small items. May spend a lot of time thinking to himself and looking for regularities in phenomena. His logic seems paradoxical to others. He is not afraid to go against conventional opinions, if he considers them outdated. Tries to make major breakthroughs and discoveries.

He is yielding in matters of everyday life and needs. Will actively resist any attempts to subordinate himself to routine or a strict schedule. Despite the fact that he is busy looking for alternatives to conventional mundane life, in difficult situations he often shows impressive ingenuity and hastiness. He cannot be reasoned with with the language of force.

ILE does not feel well interpersonal distances i.e. how close or far he is with someone. He often tries to be equally friendly to everyone. Ensures that his conversation partner expresses an interest for what he has to say. In communication, ILE is accessible and democratic. Absolutely needs periodic emotional shake-ups and upheavals; his mood is depressed within routine.
