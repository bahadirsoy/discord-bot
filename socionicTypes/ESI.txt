ESI is principled and self-sustained. Externally tends to look balanced and unemotional. Provides moral evaluations of actions of a person, but usually voices them only within a familiar circle. Has a good sense for potential foes and ill-wishers, sharply dividing people into “his own” and “others”. Does not recognize friendship and love if they are unrequited and the feelings aren’t mutual.

Lives by his present day problems rarely thinking too far ahead. Feels unsure when he takes on unfamiliar to him assignments. The closer the expected event draws, the more agitated and mobilized the ESI becomes. Dislikes being in situations of uncertainty, when he cannot definitively say yes or no.

Proactively and directly defends against attacks on himself and on those who are close to him. If he has decided to take revenge, he can find and deal a blow to the weakest spot of his opponent. Does not allow himself to be caught unawares. Sensitively reacts to being accused of unfairness and lack of objectivity. Needs to keep some physical distance, due to this dislikes spending a lot of time in physical proximity with others. Strangers and unfamiliar people in his house worry and irritate him.

When making a decision ESI internally weights its seriousness and possible negative implications. Practical in his everyday life, can put anything to use that he finds in his territory. Keeps order and tidiness in his space. Changes habits with difficulty. Will not wait if promises are not backed up by concrete actions.
