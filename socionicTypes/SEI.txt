The SEI is usually friendly and pleasant in communication. Very considerate of his own conveniences and those of others. Attentive and caring in relation to his close ones. Often takes the position of the “golden mean” in a work group. Loves beautiful objects and images, and a familiar, comfortable atmosphere.

Emotional, internally attuned to others, responsive. Seeks to cheer up others with jokes, games, witty comments, and clever retorts. Tries not to get drawn into debates and arguments, wants to be in good relations with everyone. Knows how to negotiate with people in an informal environment.

Hides his own problems. Shows courage and optimism. Won’t make promises if he’s not certain that he will be able to carry them out. Wary of people who are intrusive and who could take away his time.

Works at a pace most convenient to himself. He works productively only if he is working for himself and for the people he’s interested in. In other cases, the SEI won’t burden himself too much and will try to avoid strenuous expenditures of effort. His productivity is heavily dependent on his mood. Will try to evade boring but necessary work.
