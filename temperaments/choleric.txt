holeric

The choleric temperament is the rarest of the four primary types. Those with a choleric temperament are results-driven by making goals and sticking with them until they are completed. Thus, they exhibit a positive demeanor or disposition and are constantly moving forward. Despite any opposition, they face everything with the mindset of getting results and achieving their desires. It is more common for choleric to be a secondary temperament, although this is not as common as other combinations.

Choleric Characteristics

People with a choleric temperament are extroverted and exude self-confidence. They are independent and strong-willed and do not show signs of having a low energy level. They have quick minds and are generally active and practical in their activities, but can also be sensation seeking at times.. Their communication style is assertive and direct, often brief, almost to the point of rudeness.

This temperament type enjoys taking risks and gets bored easily. They can be domineering and opinionated. They find it easy to make decisions, not only for themselves but for others as well. They can be somewhat controlling in relationships. Choleric types also tend to require less sleep than other temperament types.

Choleric Traits

People with the choleric temperament are creative and have an outgoing disposition. They never seem to run out of ideas or plans, all of which tend to be practical. They are steadfast in their ideas, however, and will not give in to peer pressure.

While they can be compassionate and rally for social causes, they are slow to build relationships in their personal life. They likely only have a few close friends, even though they are not afraid to meet and talk to new people. They don't tend to empathize with others. However, they are also very slow to anger, though their domineering personality and direct manner of speaking can put them at higher risk of being misconstrued as anger.
