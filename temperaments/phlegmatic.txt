Phlegmatic

Phlegmatic temperaments are also common, but they can be seen as almost the opposite disposition of sanguine temperaments. People with this temperament type are service-oriented, exhibiting introverted personality traits, but will work with others to achieve a common goal. These people may seem passive and lack general ambition or specifically to accomplish a goal or milestone. However, it is also possible to have a sanguine type primarily and a secondary type of phlegmatic, or the other way around.

Phlegmatic Characteristics

The passiveness of the phlegmatic temperament type leads to a distinct set of characteristics. They are easy-going, calm, and unemotional. They can be indecisive and agreeable and are usually happy to allow others to make decisions for them.

Phlegmatic temperament people are slow to warm up to others but will make friends fairly easily. They are one of the easiest temperament types to get along with because they are so agreeable and patient. However, they stick closely to their routines and resist change.

Phlegmatic Traits

People with a phlegmatic temperament tend to live quiet lives centered around home and family. They don't get involved in the world around them or with other people. However, they also have a disposition that can be described as being fiercely loyal to their friends and will stick with a relationship regardless of what the other person does or says. However, once a relationship does break, they are not likely to return to it.

This temperament type is content to let things happen. They are not quick to make decisions, and they are not ambitious. However, they resist change and may avoid novel situations. They may need quite a bit of time and patience to adapt to change, especially sudden.
